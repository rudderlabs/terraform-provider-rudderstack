# RudderStack Provider

The RudderStack Terraform Provider allows you to access your RudderStack control plane via Terraform and manage your source-destination configurations programmatically.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    rudderstack = {
      source  = "rudderlabs/rudderstack"
      version = "~> 3.0.7"
    }
  }
  required_version = "~> 1.6.6"
}

provider "rudderstack" {
  # api_url      = "https://api.rudderstack.com/v2"
  # access_token = ""
}
```

> **:warning: Breaking Change**
> 
> Note that from the provider versions 3.0.0 and above, `onetrust_cookie_categories` property is replaced with `consent_management` that supports multiple consent management providers. Please refer to the examples in the destinations` resource guide.

> **:warning: Breaking Change**
> 
> Note that from the provider versions 1.0.0 and above, the schema of `onetrust_cookie_categories` property has been changed. Please refer to the examples in the destinations` resource guide.

## Schema

### Optional

- `access_token` (String) The Rudderstack API access token used to authenticate you Rudderstack account. If not set, the provider will look for that value in the `RUDDERSTACK_ACCESS_TOKEN` environmental value, and fail with an error if that is missing.
- `api_url` (String) The base URL of Rudderstack API. If not set, the provider will first look for a value in the `RUDDERSTACK_API_URL` environmental value, and finally default to `https://api.rudderstack.com/v2` if that is missing.
