# RudderStack Provider

The RudderStack Terraform Provider allows you to access your RudderStack control plane via Terraform and manage your source-destination configurations programmatically.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    rudderstack = {
      source  = "rudderlabs/rudderstack"
      version = "~> 0.8.1"
    }
  }
  required_version = "~> 1.1.0"
}

provider "rudderstack" {
  # api_url      = "https://api.rudderstack.com/v2"
  # access_token = ""
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `access_token` (String) The Rudderstack API access token used to authenticate you Rudderstack account. If not set, the provider will look for that value in the `RUDDERSTACK_ACCESS_TOKEN` environmental value, and fail with an error if that is missing.
- `api_url` (String) The base URL of Rudderstack API. If not set, the provider will first look for a value in the `RUDDERSTACK_API_URL` environmental value, and finally default to `https://api.rudderstack.com/v2` if that is missing.
