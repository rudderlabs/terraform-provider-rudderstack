Optional:

- `api_secret` (String, Sensitive) Mixpanel API secret
- `consolidated_page_calls` (Boolean) This will track Loaded a Page events to Mixpanel for all page method calls. We enable this by default as it's how Mixpanel suggests sending these calls.
- `cross_subdomain_cookie` (Boolean) This will allow the Mixpanel cookie to persist between different pages of your application.
- `event_filtering` (Block List, Max: 1) With this option, you can determine which events are blocked or allowed to flow through to Mixpanel. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--config--event_filtering))
- `event_increments` (List of String) Events to increment in People.
- `group_key_settings` (List of String) Group Key
- `onetrust_cookie_categories` (Block List, Max: 1) Allows you to specify the OneTrust cookie categories for each source type. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--config--onetrust_cookie_categories))

- `people_properties` (List of String) Traits to set as People Properties.
- `prop_increments` (List of String) Properties to increment in People
- `secure_cookie` (Boolean) This will mark the Mixpanel cookie as secure, meaning it will only be transmitted over https.

- `source_name` (String) This value, if it's not blank, will be sent as rudderstack_source_name to Mixpanel for every event/page/screen call.
- `super_properties` (List of String) Property to send as super Properties.
- `track_categorized_pages` (Boolean) This will track events to Mixpanel for page method calls that have a category associated with them. For example page('Docs', 'Index') would translate to Viewed Docs Index Page.

- `use_native_sdk` (Block List, Max: 1) Enable this setting to send the events via the device mode. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--config--use_native_sdk))
- `use_new_mapping` (Boolean) This value is true by default and when this flag is enabled, camel case fields are mapped to snake case fields while sending to Mixpanel.
