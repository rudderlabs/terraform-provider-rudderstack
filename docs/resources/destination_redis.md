## Schema

### Required

- `config` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) Destination specific configuration. Check the nested block documenation for more information. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--config))
- `name` (String) Human readable name of the destination. The value has to be unique across all the destinations.

### Optional

- `enabled` (Boolean) An enabled destination allows data to be sent to it.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) Time when the resource was created, in ISO 8601 format.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `updated_at` (String) Time when the resource was last updated, in ISO 8601 format.

### Nested Schema for `config`

Required:

- `address` (String) Enter the address associated with your Redis cluster.

Optional:

- `ca_certificate` (String) Enter the certificate which needs to be verified while establishing a secure connection. Skip setting this if Root CA of your server can be verified with any client, e.g. AWS Elasticache.
- `cluster_mode` (Boolean) Use this setting to enable the Redis cluster mode.
- `database` (String) RudderStack stores the user traits in the default database of the Redis instance. A different database inside the Redis instance can be configured using this setting.
- `onetrust_cookie_categories` (Block List, Max: 1) Allows you to specify the OneTrust cookie categories for each source type. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--config--onetrust_cookie_categories))
- `password` (String, Sensitive) Enter the password associated with your Redis user.
- `prefix` (String) By default, RudderStack stores user traits with the key user:<user_id>. An extra prefix can be added in the destination configuration to distinguish all RudderStack-stored keys with a prefix.
- `secure` (Boolean) Enable this setting if you want to send the data to Redis via SSL.
- `skip_verify` (Boolean) Enable this setting to skip the client's verification of the server's certificate chain and host name.
