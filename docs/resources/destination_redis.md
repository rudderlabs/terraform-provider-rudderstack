### Nested Schema for `config`

Required:

- `address` (String) Enter the address associated with your Redis cluster.

Optional:

- `ca_certificate` (String) Enter the certificate which needs to be verified while establishing a secure connection. Skip setting this if Root CA of your server can be verified with any client, e.g. AWS Elasticache.
- `cluster_mode` (Boolean) Use this setting to enable the Redis cluster mode.
- `database` (String) RudderStack stores the user traits in the default database of the Redis instance. A different database inside the Redis instance can be configured using this setting.
- `onetrust_cookie_categories` (List of String) Specify the OneTrust category name for mapping the OneTrust consent settings to RudderStack's consent purposes.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) Enter the password associated with your Redis user.
- `prefix` (String) By default, RudderStack stores user traits with the key user:<user_id>. An extra prefix can be added in the destination configuration to distinguish all RudderStack-stored keys with a prefix.
- `secure` (Boolean) Enable this setting if you want to send the data to Redis via SSL.
- `skip_verify` (Boolean) Enable this setting to skip the client's verification of the server's certificate chain and host name.
